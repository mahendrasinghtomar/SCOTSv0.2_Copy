An aircraft landing maneuver taken from https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03715 which
uses and ode solver from the boost library with an adaptive step size

0. for a successful execution of the this example you should have 32GB memory
   available

1. install the boost library  www.boost.org

2. edit the Makefile 
   adjust the compiler to your programming environment

3. compile the aircraft.cc and simulate.cc file   
   edit the Makefile and adjust the boot library path
   compile the programs by running
   $ make
   in a terminal

4. execute 
  $./aircraft
  which produces
  ./controller.scs

5. simulate the closed loop by running
  $./simulate

6. information on the example are found in
