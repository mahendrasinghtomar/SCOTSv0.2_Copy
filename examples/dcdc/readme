Controller synthesis for a DC DC boost converter to enforce a safety
specification

1. edit the Makefile 
   adjust the compiler to your programming environment

2. compile the dcdc.cc and simualte.cc file by typing in the command line
   $ make

3. execute 

  $./dcdc     
  computes the symbolic model and synthesizes the controller; the result is
  stored in controller.scs

  $./simulate
  reads the controller from file and performs the closed loop simulation.

4. simulate the closed loop in MATLAB 
  a) you need to compile the mexfile first (see the readme in $(SCOTSROOT)/mfiles/mexfiles )
  b) in Matlab add the path and run the simulation 
   >> addpath(genpath('../../mfiles'))
   >> dcdc
