Helper programs to compute an apriori enclosure of the aircraft ODE. The
computation uses the interval arithmetic based solution of ODEs implemented in
the C++ package vnodelp available at 

http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~nedialk/vnodelp/


The program comp_enclosure.cc computes an a priori enclosure.

How to use:

1. install the vnodelp package  

  We installed vnodelp with Profil-2.0.8. For a successful compilation of
  Profil-2.0.8 under macOS we had to edit the assembler file fpRound.s under 
  Profil-2.0.8/x86-64-Linux-compat-gcc/
  to account for the different function naming strategies of macOS assembly vs linux
  assembly code. 

  Alternatively, vnodelp can also be installed with Filib++.

2. edit the Makefile and adjust it to your programming environemnt, adjust header and library paths

  the current makefile is supposed to be used with vnodelp in combination with
  BIAS/Profil

  If you chose to install vnodelp with Filib++ you need to adjust the makefile
  accordingly

  Note: the MAXORDER number must coincide with the MAXORDER number used in the
  compilation of the vnodelp package

3. the a priori enclosure depends on the following parameters which you can 
   adapt to your needs

   - the sampling time
   - the state space bounds
   - the input space bounds
   - disturbances
   - measurment error bound

4. compile comp_enclosure.cc via make
