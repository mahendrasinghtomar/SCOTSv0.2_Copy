A path planning problem for a vehicle using the bycicle model based on the BDD
data structure. It uses a customized computation of the symbolic model to
account for the 2Pi periodicity of the orientation of the vehicle.

0. To run this example, you need to the Cudd libarary installed. Please see the
   manual for installation notes

1. edit the Makefile adjust the compiler to your programming environment


2. compile the vehicle.cc and simulate.cc
   $ make
   in a terminal

3. execute 

  $./vehicle

  which produces

  ./controllerT1.scs   // controller files to steer system in T1
  ./controllerT1.bdd

  ./controllerT2.scs   // controller files to steer system in T2
  ./controllerT2.bdd

  ./obstacles.scs
  ./obstacles.bdd
  ./target.scs
  ./target.bdd

4. simulate the closed loop by running

  $./simulate

5. simulate the closed loop in MATLAB 
  a) you need to compile the mexfile first (see the readme in $(SCOTSROOT)/mfiles/mexfiles )
  b) in Matlab add the path and run the simulation 
   >> addpath(genpath('../../mfiles'))
   >> vehicle
